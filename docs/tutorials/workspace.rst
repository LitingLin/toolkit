Workspace details
=================

A workspace is the top-level container for all of your data, experiments, and artifacts. The CLI can only manipulate a limited subset of the workspace's properties, more can be achieved by looking at its structure and files.

Structure
---------

The workspace is a directory with the following structure:

 * sequences/ - a directory containing all the sequences in the workspace
 * results/ - a directory containing all the results in the workspace
 * cache/ - a directory containing all the cache in the workspace
 * analysis/ - a directory containing all the analysis in the workspace

Configuration
-------------

The workspace has a configuration file called `config.yaml` that contains all the configuration for the workspace. This file is usually automatically generated by the CLI, but can also be edited manually or even created from scratch.
